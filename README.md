Othello AI

I grew up playing video games. Sometimes, people employed 'bots', which were autonomous agents to give the player an advantage in game. For games like Runescape and World of Warcraft, bots were commonly used to gather resources while a player was away. For strategy games like Chess, League of Legends, and Go, bots were developed with the purpose of creating an unbeatable artificial player. 

The purpose of this project is to Build an AI-powered bot. I chose to create an Othello bot. Othello is also known as "Reversi". Othello is a two player game, and one can win with the consistent application of a few key strategies. It may take years for people to develop this level of consistency, but my bot can apply these strategies perfectly every time.
